<h1>Speaking</h1>
<p>I speak at development and design conferences all over - presenting my work has taken me to Portland, Austin, Milan and points between. Check out a few of my talks below. If you would like me to speak at your event, please <a href="mailto:michael@michaelboeke.com">drop me a line</a>.</p>

<h2 class="talk-title">Designing for Trust</h2>
<a class="tag">SXSW '15</a> <a class="tag">Codemotion Milan '15</a>

<p>This talk reviews some of the factors that engender trust, like reputation, transparency and consent. It also explores some real world examples of products that do a great job of establishing trust, and some others that...miss the mark. The audience should walk out with a better understanding of the issues surrounding privacy and trust, as well as some practical tools for making software products more trustworthy.</p>

<p>In this presentation, I explore the global shift to mobile commerce. I look at emerging hardware and software technologies behind an explosion of experimentation in how we pay for almost everything. I also look at the ways designers and developers can create great experiences in the world of mobile commerce.</p>

<h2 class="talk-title">UX Antipatterns</h2>
  <a class="tag">SXSW '14'</a>
  <a class="tag">Codemash '14</a>
  <a class="tag">That Conference '14</a>
  <a class="tag">Warm Gun '13</a>
<script async class="speakerdeck-embed" data-id="25a4ba4004960132387f0e965c49b3ca" data-ratio="1.61259842519685" src="//speakerdeck.com/assets/embed.js"></script>
<p>In this session, I discuss user experience antipatterns - design conventions that appear to be good solutions at first, but actually end up hampering usability. I look at a number of real life antipatterns collected from around the web, and explore some better approaches. The audience should walk away with a few new items in their design toolkit, and an increased awareness (and wariness) of design conventions.</p>
