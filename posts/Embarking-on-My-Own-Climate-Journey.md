<p>I have been aware of climate change and energy issues since childhood, but until recently, it always seemed like a problem for someone else to solve.  My father was deeply affected by the energy crisis of the '70s, and being conscientious about energy use was part of our family life. He was always doing projects like installing insulation in our house and turning down the thermostat <i>Put on some socks if you're cold!</i></p>

<p>Sometimes, this felt pretty tedious - like when he would make me line up all the refrigerated items when cleaning up from dinner, so I would only have to open the refrigerator once and thus conserve a little energy. Other times were a lot of fun, like when we built a solar cooker in his basement workshop and brought it to school to cook hot dogs on the playground for my 4th-grade class. His day job was teaching at our local community college, but he found a way to bring his passion around energy to his professional life by creating a course called <i>Energy & Society</i>. He also had a side-hustle consulting with businesses to help them save money by reducing their energy usage.</p>

<p>My own career designing, developing, and managing digital products has been more rewarding than I ever would have imagined as a student. However, I have never seen how my professional skills would be applicable to solving climate problems. After all, I am not a scientist, engineer, or policy expert. Besides, other people have been making progress on electric cars and solar power without my help, right?</p>

<p>These days, I have children of my own. While I certainly cared about environmental issues before I became a parent, there is nothing that brings your values into focus like viewing them through the eyes of your children. Now I'm the dad who turns down the thermostat and yells at the rest of the family to put some socks on (admittedly, I still open the fridge a lot.) So, in the last few years, I've become keenly aware of the world my kids will inherit. That despite our fabulous progress in some areas, we are still far behind where we need to be in the fight against climate change. At the same time, I also discovered that digital technology has a role to play and that most "hard" climate technologies also have a software component. So, maybe this is my problem to solve (or at least work on) after all?</p>

<p>I'm taking another cue from my dad and trying to figure out how to apply my professional skills to help address the climate crisis. That doesn't necessarily mean switching jobs, as I am exploring other ways to contribute my skills and efforts outside of my primary work:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Advocating for climate issues at work and in my community
    <li>Connecting people in my professional network with jobs in climate tech
    <li>Investing in companies that are innovating solutions to climate problems
</ul>

<p>Taking inspiration from Jason Jacobs' <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/my-climate-journey/id1462776122">influential podcast</a>, I'm embarking on my own climate journey. This is new territory for me, and I am deep in learning mode at this point. I've been reading everything I can on the subject of climate change, listening to experts on podcasts like <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/catalyst-with-shayle-kann/id1593204897">Catalyst</a>, and networking with the passionate members of the <a href="https://www.mcjcollective.com/">MCJ Collective</a>. I'm going to chronicle my journey here in the hopes that it might be helpful to others on a similar path.</p>
