<p>I have been aware of climate change and energy issues since childhood, but until lately, it always seemed like a problem for someone else to solve. My father was a community college professor who taught a course called Energy & Society and consulted with businesses to help them conserve energy. So, I have a role model for working in climate and energy from before the term "climate tech" existed.</p>

<p> My own career designing, developing, and managing digital products has been more rewarding than I ever would have imagined as a student. However, I have never seen how my professional skills would be directly applicable to solving climate problems. After all, I am not a scientist, engineer, or policy expert. Besides, other people have been making progress on electric cars and solar power without my help, right?</p>

<p>Well...in the last few years I've become more keenly aware that despite our fabulous progress in some areas, we are still far behind where we need to be in the fight against climate change. At the same time, Iâ€™ve started to realize that digital technology has a role to play and that most "hard" climate technologies also have a digital component. So, maybe this is my problem to solve (or at least work on) after all?</p>

<p>Also, there may be other ways to contribute my skills and efforts outside of my primary job:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Advocating for climate issues at work and in my community
    <li>Connecting people in my professional network with jobs in climate tech
    <li>Investing in companies that are innovating solutions to climate problems
</ul>

<p>Taking inspiration from Jason Jacobs' <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/my-climate-journey/id1462776122">influential podcast</a>, I'm embarking on my own climate journey. This is new territory for me, and I am deep in learning mode at this point. I've been reading everything I can on the subject of climate change, listening to experts on podcasts like <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/catalyst-with-shayle-kann/id1593204897">Catalyst</a> and networking with the passionate members of the <a href="https://www.mcjcollective.com/">MCJ Collective</a>. I'm going to chronicle my journey here in the hopes that it might be helpful to others on a similar path.</p>
